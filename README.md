Introduction:

Pediasite – site for babies, has an aim of providing the newly born babies with proper care through their parents. Although the parents love their babies and want them to keep safe from every possible harm, but due to illiteracy or say lack of good knowledge on proper diet their babies don’t grow healthy. In many cases most babies even die which has alarmingly increased the rate of under-five mortality rate throughout the country. 

Recently considering this many NGOs and INGOs has started conducting awareness campaign and vaccination for newly born babies which has somewhat reduced the overall death rate of the babies but still the problem prevails. We believe that through our site prepared from thorough study and research, we could make the parents aware enough for their baby’s care so that they won’t have to hire babysitter which would prevent their useless expenses. 

We also aim in educating the parents in the verge of having birth about the healthy habits and diet routine they should follow during the period of pregnancy which would be beneficial for their child to be born.

Objectives: 

We have the following objectives for our project:

1. To facilitate parents of a new born child in complications
2. To aware those parents about the healthy habits and notify them about the location of the  health centers
3. To learn basics of web development
